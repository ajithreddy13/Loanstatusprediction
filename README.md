# Loanstatusprediction

A machine learning project that predicts loan approval status based on applicant data.

##  About

This project utilizes a dataset containing various features of loan applicants to predict whether their loan application will be approved. It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation techniques.

##  Model Overview

The model is trained using supervised learning algorithms to classify loan applications as approved or not approved. The dataset includes features such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and more.

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

##  Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Loan Prediction Problem](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset). It includes information on loan applicants and their loan status.

##  Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajithreddy13/Loanstatusprediction.git

##How to work
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook ML_loan_status.ipynb
 
##Future Work

Improve model accuracy by exploring advanced algorithms.
Deploy the model using a web framework like Flask or Django.
Integrate a user-friendly interface for inputting applicant data.
